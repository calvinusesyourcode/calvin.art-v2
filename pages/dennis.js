    is integrated to automate and optimize where possible, allowing the humans in the loop to focus on what's really important. \n \n I venture
    to provide extremely robust return on investment, but I am negotiable on price because I really want to work for you.`
    const text2 = `Since we last spoke I have dived deep into programmingâ€”building programs, studying algorithms and math concepts.\
    \n\n And this past month I have learned true web development (without no-code tools like wordpress or wix) by building Neil a new website.`
    const text3 = `The first thing I want to implement for NSC is the successor to that website.`
    const text4 = `Because: \n\n * Dead-simple project documentation system where employees or supervisors on-the-ground can upload pictures, notes, and other information to the project\
    \n\n * That system could also have functionality where employees can upload internal data for supervisors to see (punch in, punch out, notes, etc)\
    \n\n * Access to raw code enables deep website analytics for when I do experiments for Special Projects advertising
    \n\n * Easily connect data like project info to social media posts and blog posts automatically
    \n\n * Automate repetitive tasks that a human would have to do
    \n\n * Sidestepping providers like wordpress enables us to leverage coding abilities of artificial intelligence (AI)
    \n\n * No subscription: You own the code for your website.
    \n\n * Built within 30 days.
    \n\n And:\
    \n\n * For any additional clients you refer to me, we can discuss profit share. Something like 10%. Negotiable.
    \n\n * I will construct the website in such a manner that porting Aslan's website over, if you like, will be even easier. Retaining all the web design on there that you love.
    `
    const text5 = `Bonus:
    \n\n * I still want to do those testimonial videos. Perhaps the $1000 price tag scared you off. What about $600 for the same amount of work/quality?
    \n\n * I am in touch with some videography students and so we would love to tackle the medical sector video for NSC as well.`
    const text6 = `I am ready to start immediately and am very excited to work together.`
